<-> Take a look at why do we need to multiply the projected points in the screen by the screen half size and add it later on.



POST IMPLEMENTATION:
 - Texture importing from png -> for this I would like to allocate the memory contiguously for all the possible textures in the app, so we avoid runtime fragmentation or cache misses
   -> figure out the best way here, since we could have 10k images, but not memory for all would be needed to be allocated... Maybe just reserving some memory for this, and if the textures, 
      exceed the memory, then we just complain.
       <-> Preallocating memory for textures, at runtime load the textures in here, if textures too big, then complain.


 - Create a more reliable method for creating the objects and importing textures, maybe with the level serialization.



TODO: 
- Create a cube struct for defining the state of init and the different triangles.
- Solid understanding of the index array and faces, etc.




// TEXTURE MAPPING UV
- save the texture ref in the mesh itself.
- fix the artifacts caused by the slope calculation, so the x_start and x_end results in a very large number in the textured triangle function.
